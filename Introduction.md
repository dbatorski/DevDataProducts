## Introduction - The Digital Agenda 

The [Digital Agenda for Europe](<http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/digital-agenda-europe>) is the EU's strategy to help digital technologies, including the internet, to deliver sustainable economic growth. One of the goals of Digital Agenda is to ensure that by 2020 all Europeans can have access to much faster internet (see: [link1](<http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/our-goals/pillar-iv-fast-and-ultra-fast-internet-access>)).

"_The EU aims to bring basic broadband to all Europeans by 2013 and to ensure that, by 2020,_ 

* _all Europeans have access to much higher internet speeds of above 30 Mbps and_ 

* _50% or more of European households subscribe to internet access above 100 Mbps._"


## The App

The goals of Digital Agenda and target values for broadband capacity in 2020 may seem too ambitious. This Shiny app was developed by [Dominik Batorski](<pl.linkedin.com/in/dbatorski/>) to verify whether these targets are realistic for Poland, which is the sixth largest country in EU.

### Internet speed 2003-2013

The plot in "Internet speed 2003-2013" tab presents the distribution of internet connections with different bandwiths in households in Poland between 2003 and 2013. You may observe a rapid growth of internet access with higher speeds.


### Prediction 2020

Between 2003 and 2013 __an average internet speed in connected households in Poland doubled every 18 months__. 
In "Prediction 2020" tab you can test 3 scenarios to predict future average values of internet bandwith as well as percentages 
of households with 30Mbps and 100Mbps, i.e. the goals of the Digital Agenda.
          

## Conclusions

This app shows that it should be relatively easy to fulfill the goal of 100Mbps in more than 50% of households in Poland by 2020. On the other hand, if current trends continue, the objective of 30Mbps for all households seems to be almost impossible to achieve.
